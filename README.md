# Grasp-And-Lift-EEG-Detection

## Hub of Project
Taiwan

## Background: 
Motor imagery is a crucial application method of brain-computer interfaces. 
The relationship between hand motion and EEG signals is significant.

## Data Set: An EEG data set from Kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/grasp-and-lift-eeg-detection/data

12 subjects in total
10 series of trials for each subject
approximately 30 trials within each series

### 6 phases of hand motion:
1. HandStart
2. FirstDigitTouch
3. BothStartLoadPhase
4. LiftOff
5. Replace
6. BothReleased

## Goals: 
To classify the 6 different phases accurately.
Achieve at least 80% accuracy 

## Method and Tools: 
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Optimization Algorithms

## Motivation: 
Gain practical experience in analyzing EEG signals for BCI applications.

Even if I cannot successfully complete this challenge and achieve the desired results
I hope I can learn how to implement signal processing tools and method for BCI application through this project.
